  * `npm run bootstrap`
* init-db(deprecated) - will initialize the database tables
  * `npm run init-db`

## Frontend
### To install
`cd app` to get into the app folder
run `npm install` to install all frontend dependencies

### To run
* `npm run serve` - This serves the frontend on port 9000 with hot-reload (the changes you save will be reflected immediately in the website). Use this to develop.
* `npm run lint` - This can fix linter errors and make the code compliant to the standard. Be careful when using this, as it makes changes automatically to the code, and all new features should definitely be checked again afterwards.
* `npm run build` - Builds the project to be served statically by the server. This is used by heroku so we aren't committing compiled assets to the server.

## Technologies used within the app
* [express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) as a server
* [sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) as an orm
* [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) as a testing framework
